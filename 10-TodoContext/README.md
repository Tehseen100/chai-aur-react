# Todo App (React Context Practice)

This project is a **learning exercise** to practice React fundamentals, especially the **Context API** and state management patterns.

The goal is to understand **how and where state and logic should live**, not to build a production-ready or marketable application.

## Basic Features

- Add a todo
- Edit a todo
- Toggle completion
- Delete a todo
- Persist todos in localStorage

## Notes

- This code is intentionally simple.
- Some decisions are made for learning clarity, not scalability.
- The project may be refactored multiple times as part of practice.
